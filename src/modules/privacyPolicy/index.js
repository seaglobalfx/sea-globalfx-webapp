The provision of such information is mandatory for account opening and for the continuation of our business relationship. Failure

                        Personal data is retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and to meet legal, regulatory, and operational requirements. Where complete deletion of data is not technically feasible, Sea Global FX implements
                        measures to restrict further processing and prevent misuse of retained information in accordance with applicable data protection standards.
