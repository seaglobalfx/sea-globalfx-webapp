                    <p>
                        Trading in leveraged products, including CFDs, involves a high level of risk and may result in losses exceeding the Client’s initial investment. CFDs are settled on the difference between opening and closing prices and do not involve ownership of underlying assets. Clients should carefully assess their financial situation, investment objectives, and risk tolerance prior to trading. Trading is conducted at the Client’s own risk, and Sea Global FX does not guarantee profits or protection
                        from losses.

                        the Client.
